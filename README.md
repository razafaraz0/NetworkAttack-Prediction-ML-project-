# NetworkAttack-Prediction-ML-Project

The purpose of this project is to build a secure network intrusion predictor. We will define an intrusion as the act of intruding or gaining unauthorized access to a system.

Attacks fall into four main categories: 
  1. DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;
  2. R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password 
  3. U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various ``buffer overflow'' attacks
  4. Probing: surveillance e.g., port scanning.

Different machine learning techniques were, some of them include Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√ØveBayes and logistic regression classifiers.
